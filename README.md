# motor-threshold-estimation
To perform safe and effective transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the resting motor threshold (rMT) of any subject must be determined. On this page you will find the necessary software, setup, and steps to do so.

## Background
Flow of current in a magnetic coil and induced current in brain tissue are shown in this diagram. An electric field is induced perpendicular to the magnetic field in the coil. An electrode is placed over the cortex of the M1 muscle, and a magnetic coil is placed on the target muscle, the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseus (FDI). For the FDI and APB muscles, MEP responses are detected with channels Ch1 and Ch2.
